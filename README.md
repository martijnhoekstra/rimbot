# rimbot
IRC bot to manage rimworld queue for fgsquared

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/martijnhoekstra/rimbot.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/martijnhoekstra/rimbot)

The project builds out of the box with [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/), and packages with one-jar. If you'd like to use a different build system, pull requests for issue #14 are welcome.

This software is free software, licensed under the AGPLv3. That means anyone is free to run the bot unmodified.

If you make modifications to the bot and run it, you *must* make the source code of the bot available, and at least provide a link to the source in it's interactions. The current bot does this through the !source command, and it's recommended you do the same.
